## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It's been a while since I made anything for web. This project was a good way for me to brush up on the foundations like HTML, CSS, and flex box.

In particular, I made liberal use of CSS variables since I hadn't used them much before.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - Referencing the docs was a must! While I knew for the most part what to do, I needed a good brush up of keywords and syntax.
